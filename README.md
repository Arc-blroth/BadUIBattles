# BadUIBattles
## and other useless projects for teh interwebz

Welcome to Arc'blroth's Repository of Useless Projects.
This repository contains a collection of projects in a variety of programming languages,
most of which serve no real purpose and are designed to be esoteric.

As the repository name suggests, many of the projects here are submissions to the r/BadUIBattles subreddit.

Building and running instructions are contained in the README file in each project folder.
